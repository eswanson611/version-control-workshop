## Introduction

The Rockefeller Archive Center provides public access to its extensive archival holdings through its two Reading Rooms. This manual serves as a guide for all staff who work in the Reading Rooms or with onsite researchers. It covers topics such as researcher orientation, Reading Room procedures, the handling of archival materials, and duplication requests.

## Reading Room Policies

The Reading Room policies and procedures help to ensure the protection of the archival materials being used in the Reading Room as well as to provide equal access to open records. The interviewing archivist and desk monitor should reinforce what can be brought in the Reading Room, what should remain in the lockers or lounge, and how records should be handled.

### Outside Items in the Reading Room

The following **are** allowed in the Reading Room: pencils, paper/notes, laptop computers, tablets, cameras, and cell phones. The volume should be silent on all electronic devices. Reading room monitors check loose papers and notebooks at the end of the day.

The following **are not** allowed in the Reading Room: food, beverages, tobacco items (smoking is prohibited in the building), chewing gum, pens, handheld scanners, briefcases, computer cases, bags, purses, excessive papers or notebooks, and coats and other outerwear. If a researcher takes off a hat, scarf, sweater, or jacket while working in the Reading Room, it should immediately be placed in a locker. Suitcases can be stored in the coat closet on the first floor.

### Handling Materials

Standardized practices for researchers handling archival materials are described below:
* Researchers are limited to one folder at a time, keeping the folder flat on the table with the contents always within it, and reading and turning the pages like they were a book. They should use an Out card to mark the folder’s place in the box.
* For nontraditional containers (such as accordion folders or boxes of index cards), the monitor should engage with the researcher about proper handling and an appropriate solution for using the Out card.
* Researchers may not rearrange the order of materials in folders nor the order of folders in boxes.
* They should turn the pages within a folder or bound volume gently.
* They should not lean on, write on, fold, bend, fasten, or unfasten archival materials.
* They should use weights and/or cradles with bound volumes.
* They may insert a piece of acid-free paper under thin paper as needed when taking photos.
* They should not walk around the room with archival materials. The desk monitor should go to them to answer a question about the records.
* They may not remove materials from the Reading Room.
* They should always leave the call slips in place so that the barcode can be easily scanned.

### Camera Policy
Researchers are permitted to photograph archival materials with a handheld camera or device. To adhere to U.S. copyright law, photographs may be taken only for personal scholarly use. The RAC [Camera Policy](http://www.rockarch.org/research/inforesearch.php#digital) lists what is permissible when taking photographs in the Reading Room.

## Researcher Orientation
The Reading Room is open Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. For a list of holidays and early closings, see the [RAC website](http://www.rockarch.org/research/inforesearch.php).

The Archive Center provides a free shuttle from and to the Tarrytown train station that meets the following trains:
* Departs Grand Central at 8:46 a.m. and arrives in Tarrytown at 9:23 a.m. The van arrives at RAC at approximately 9:40 a.m.
* Departs Tarrytown at 5:34pm and arrives at Grand Central at 6:17 p.m. The van leaves RAC at 5:15 p.m.

For a researcher arriving for the first time, there are several steps to the orientation and registration process. Appendix A contains a list of the individual steps involved in orientation. It is the responsibility of the archivist conducting the research interview to meet the researcher upon arrival and follow the steps on the Research Orientation Checklist (see Appendix A) to ensure a consistent orientation is provided for everyone doing research at the Archive Center. For a returning researcher who has not been to the RAC in more than a year, the interviewing archivist provides a refresher on Reading Room policies and procedures.

## Reading Room Procedures
### Reading Room Layout and Supplies

The main Reading Room can accommodate seven researchers; the second Reading Room (in the secondfloor library) can accommodate four researchers. Researcher desks are numbered one through eleven on the seating charts. Each Reading Room has a desk monitor.

Researchers may use the microfilm machines unattended. Several ViewScan microfilm machines are located in or adjacent to the Reading Rooms.

Desk monitors should familiarize themselves with the various office supplies at the reference desk, most of which should not be provided to a researcher unless it is being used away from the archival material. Citation slips, weights, pencils, and outcards are on the reference desks, while extra supplies, blue/green/yellow duplication slips, gloves, and various paper products are in the alcove between the two rooms. The bottom drawer of each reference desk contains blank seating charts and orientation checklists, various permission forms, signed copies of the orientation checklists, and completed seating charts from the current year.

If you notice that any of the forms are running low, either request assistance to refill them or refill them once your shift has finished. Most forms are available at S:\Inter-Office\Archival\Forms\Reference forms. For the colored duplication slips, contact the Facilities Coordinator.

### Opening the Reading Room
The first desk shift begins at 8:45 a.m. In addition to standard Reading Room responsibilities, the first shift should do the following:

Turn on the Reading Room computer.

Bring the carts to the Reading Room by 9:00. Ensure that the correct carts are being brought up by comparing the Outlook Reading Room calendar with the cart notes.

In Aeon, scan all items on the carts to the status “On Hold in Reading Room.”

Place the carts by the tables. Carts should go closest to the wall, and for the two desks in the middle of the Main Room, carts should be placed on the side closest to the Reading Room entrance.

See the “Aeon Guides for the RAC" (S:\Inter-Office\Reference\Aeon Guides for the RAC) folder for details on seating arrangement. If possible, seat returning researchers at the desk they sat at previously. **Do not** write the researchers’ names on the seating chart until they physically arrive in the Reading Room.

### Checking Researchers Into the Reading Room
When a researcher arrives in the Reading Room for the first time each day, the monitor should:

* Greet the researcher and indicate the assigned table.
* Hand an Out card to the researcher.
* Write the researcher’s name on the seating chart.
* In Aeon, sign the researcher into the correct Reading Room and seat number.
* In Aeon, move the researcher’s materials from the “On Hold in Reading Room” to the “Checked Out to Researcher” queue.
